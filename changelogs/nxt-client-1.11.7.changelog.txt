IGNIS Token Sale UI bugfixes and improvements:

Add paging buttons to the exchange history table on the Ignis page.

Initialize the JLRDA units field to 0.

Fixed "calculate fee" when connecting to a remote node with remembered
passphrase.

Implemented TransactionScheduler, added ScheduleCurrencyBuy and
GetScheduledTransactions APIs.

Note that these APIs were specifically added for the purpose of the IGNIS
Token Sale, and may be removed or modified in the future.


Other fixes and improvements:

Allow blacklisting the real remote host, not the proxy, when running a public
node behind a reverse proxy. Use the nxt.forwardedForHeader property to
configure the header added by the proxy to the API http requests (normally
X-Forwarded-For).

Fixed printing of paper wallet for passphrases containing special characters.

WARNING: If you printed out a paper wallet for an account passphrase which
contains special characters using an earlier release, this passphrase may have
been printed out incorrectly, with those characters missing, or truncated. In
this case you are advised to print out a correct copy using this version. The
QR codes were not affected by this bug, and neither were the standard account
passphrases generated by the client.
